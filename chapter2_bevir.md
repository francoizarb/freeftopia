####Abstract

How have organization theories influenced reform of the governance of corporations, public bodies, and global affairs? ‘Organizational governance’ explains how organization theory typically focuses on three ideal types of governance: hierarchies, markets, and networks. Each of these types depends on a particular form of governance to coordinate actions. However, it is people, not abstract models, that determine the nature and behaviour of an organization, since organizations are made up of living people and their actions. Social scientists have often adopted formal theories of organization without considering historical narratives about societies and states, and reforms based on such theories have often failed.


#### Chapter body
The resurgence of the word ‘governance’ arose from theoretical and empirical challenges to the idea of the state as a unified sovereign entity that encompassed people with a shared culture and a common good. When social scientists challenged this concept of the state, many of them adopted formal modernist theories of social organization. Governance provided a theoretical term to discuss general issues of social coordination irrespective of whether or not government played an active role in such coordination. Instead of historical narratives about societies and states, social scientists adopted formal theories of organization.

Modernist organization theory characteristically provides typologies describing and explaining different types of coordination. Most of the typologies focus on three ideal types: hierarchy, market, and network. Each of the ideal types relies on a particular form of governance to coordinate actions. Hierarchies rely on authority and centralized control. Markets rely on prices and dispersed competition. Networks rely on trust across webs of associations. Further, modernist social scientists link these different forms of governance to other organizational characteristics, including the basis of relations among members of the organization, the degree of the members’ dependence on each other, approaches to resolving conflicts, and the general organizational culture. Box 1 provides an overview of the resulting typology.

This chapter will discuss abstract organization theories of hierarchy, market, and network. It is important to remember that these theories have influenced management and administration. Organization theories have led decision-makers to reform the governance of corporations, public bodies, and global affairs. Organization theories helped inspire the rise of new practices and agendas of governance.


#### Hierarchies

According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the word ‘hierarchy’ was first used in English in 1880 to refer to an order of angels. Before long, however, ‘hierarchy’ was being used to describe the organizational structures of public bureaucracies and private firms. Modernist organization theory arose out of the work of Max Weber (1864–1920), a German sociologist. Weber's study of bureaucracy suggested that it had a central authority based on rationality and law. This central authority presided over a chain of (p. 18) subordinate units that performed increasingly specialized functions. Each higher unit exercised command and control over the units immediately beneath it. Each lower unit was accountable to the unit immediately above it. During the early twentieth century, management theorists began to study the firm as an organization. Scholars wanted to understand the role of the firm in the economy, and also to help managers promote efficiency.

Hierarchies are thought to work best when an organization has a fairly clear purpose. Bureaucracies in the public sector are meant to pursue the public good. Firms in the private sector are meant to pursue profit. The existence of a clear purpose means that hierarchies can divide their activities into a clear set of functions that can be assigned to different units. Further, the function of each unit can be divided into sub-sets that can be assigned to sub-units. The result is a nested or pyramidal structure of units, each consisting of sub-units all the way to the bottom. There might be twenty units at the bottom, overseen at the next level up by seven units, overseen by three, which are then controlled by the one unit at the apex of the organization.

This pyramidal structure means that hierarchies can divide complex tasks into more manageable ones. Consequently, hierarchies encourage a division of labour and thus specialization. Each unit has its specialized function and specific tasks. Higher-level units coordinate the various functions of the lower-level units. Other characteristics of modern hierarchies follow from this specialization. For example, hierarchies often give great scope to written documents as guides and records of action, and they often recruit experts or provide expert training to take on certain tasks.

It is the pyramidal structure of hierarchies that makes management so important within them. Each unit has to manage the sub-units under its control. Decisions and rules often come from the top and flow downwards. Often the higher levels of the pyramid concentrate on devising and coordinating strategies and (p. 19) policies, the mid-levels then translate the strategies and policies into directives, and the lower levels put the directives into practice. Each unit needs to oversee and direct its subordinates in order to make sure that the strategies and policies are rightly understood and applied. Each unit commands those that are immediately below it. Each unit is controlled by that immediately above it. Strict rules and clear lines of authority facilitate oversight and accountability.

The members of a hierarchy are usually employees. They retain their individual freedom unlike, for example, slaves. But they have a contractual obligation to spend some time working on behalf of the hierarchy and fulfilling some task within it. Usually they are employed and later promoted on the basis of their formal qualifications, merits, and technical expertise. Wage levels and other compensation typically increase as people move up the hierarchy. Those further up the hierarchy often decide whom to promote to senior positions. Alternatively, issues of appointment and promotion can be handled by a particular unit within the organization. Throughout the hierarchy clear rules govern the behaviour of employees. When people break the rules, they are disciplined.

Generally hierarchies rely on a rule-based approach to authority. Hierarchy is an impersonal order. The places and duties of the people within hierarchies are defined formally. Although the relevant people may have personal relationships with one another, their professional relationships depend on their places in the organization. For example, when someone higher up the organization tells a subordinate to do something, the subordinate obeys less because of the personal qualities of the higher-up than because of the formal position of the higher-up as ‘a boss’. Again, when subordinates have a grievance with a boss, they typically have recourse to a formal process of appeal in which their grievance is judged by reference to the written rules that govern the organization. Abstract rules and formal relationships thus (p. 20) define people's place in a hierarchy. Authority depends on the offices that people hold in the organization.

There is, however, some dispute about the nature of the authority in hierarchies. Weber argued that hierarchy went with a rational and legal form of authority. In his view authority can be charismatic, traditional, or rational-legal. Charismatic authority is always unstable as it relies on particular individuals. Traditional authority provides more stability by sanctifying historic customs, practices, and orders. In modern life legitimacy depends on a belief in the legality of a set of rules and in the right that these rules give people in certain positions to command others. For Weber, bureaucracies characteristically rely on this rational-legal authority to institutionalize abstract rules and relationships. In contrast, Herbert A. Simon later argued that hierarchies need not depend on any particular type of authority. He defined hierarchy solely by the nested structure of its units. In this view hierarchy need not be a top-down organization. Hierarchies can arise from subordinates passing authority upwards. Consent can be as important as abstract rules in sustaining a pyramidal structure.

Hierarchic organizations have some clear advantages. Their pyramidal structure allows complex tasks to be divided into more manageable chunks. It also allows routine tasks to be delegated downwards. More recently, organization theorists have discussed the advantages of hierarchies by asking why they arise. Economists predictably argue that hierarchies are a response to market failure. In this view hierarchies provide a way of reducing transaction costs and limiting exposure to risk. Alternatively sociologists argue that hierarchy corresponds to a modern western concept of rationality and that hierarchies spread along with this concept. In this view hierarchies provide at least the appearance of an impartial expertise.

In addition to being particularly efficient at certain tasks, hierarchic organizations have some widely recognized moral and (p. 21) political advantages. Liberal democracy is often thought to depend on clear lines of accountability: administrators must be accountable to elected politicians who are then accountable to voters. Hierarchy facilitates these lines of accountability by institutionalizing clearly defined responsibilities and relationships. Hierarchy makes it easy to recognize that a person P is accountable to another Q for the performance of a task T. Accountability is, moreover, an important aspect of many other public goals. The protection of human rights and the equal treatment of citizens depend on formal rules and relationships and on proper procedures of appeal. Formal rules and relationships are a barrier to corruption and official bias.

Although hierarchies have advantages, they also have limitations. Indeed, by the 1960s and 1970s many organization theorists had begun to emphasize the failings of hierarchy rather more than its advantages. Critics argue that hierarchies are unresponsive and inefficient. Hierarchies are unresponsive insofar as their employees concentrate on obeying the rules that apply within the hierarchy rather than on reacting to the wishes of those outside of it, such as customers or citizens. Similarly, hierarchies are inefficient insofar as their employees follow orders and procedures even when these are anything but optimal. Some critics point here to the effect that hierarchies can have on the minds of the employees within them. Employees might concentrate on their own safety or on improving their own position in the organization at the expense of the good of the organization as a whole. Again, they might appeal to the existing rules to protect themselves, not to improve their performance. In doing so they might become risk averse. The organization might then stagnate.

There are some types of task for which hierarchy seems particularly inappropriate. One example is tasks for which there are no clear criteria of success—perhaps including creative innovation. Hierarchies rely on the ability of bosses to supervise subordinates. If there are no clear guidelines on what (p. 22) subordinates should do or on how they should do it, then this supervision cannot work properly. It is difficult to deal properly with ambiguity and flexibility in hierarchical organizations that rely on formal rules and relationships. Another example is change and adaptation. Hierarchies rely on institutionalized roles and procedures. If an organization's environment changes, its established procedures may be of little use in the new circumstances. It can be difficult to adapt—and especially to adapt quickly and continuously—if one has to follow outdated guidelines.

#### Markets

As criticisms of hierarchy spread, so some organization theorists began to trumpet the virtues of markets. Neoliberals often suggested that markets and market mechanisms were some kind of panacea. The formalism of modernist economics typically postulated an abstract concept of the market as intrinsically producing an efficient equilibrium. By abstracting markets from history, economists could conclude that apart from a few exceptional circumstances there is no reason to replace markets with other forms of organization.

The idea of the market as a type of organization is an abstraction from an actual market place. As an abstract concept, however, a market need not have any particular physical location. The market is, in other words, a more or less formal arena in which goods are exchanged for other goods and especially money. So conceived, the market involves two parties voluntarily exchanging goods at a given price. On one side, there are sellers who have goods they bring to the market. The sellers create the supply of goods. On the other side, there are customers who want to acquire goods at the market. The customers create the demand for the goods. Interactions among the sellers and customers establish the price of the goods. The goods are exchanged for the market price. Generally formal analyses of the market suggest that the price (p. 23) mechanism means that markets tend to equilibrium. Markets are in equilibrium when the total supply of a good equals the total demand for that good. In theory, this equilibrium is the state of affairs in which none of the sellers or customers could make themselves better off by altering the amount of goods they buy at the existing prices.

Modernist economics includes two slightly different views of the market. The dominant neoclassical view emphasizes perfect competition. In this view separate firms try to maximize their profits by responding to changes in prices. Decision-makers have the necessary information about market conditions and prices. This information leads them to alter their behaviour by, for example, producing more of one good and less of another, increasing the price they charge for a good, or buying a new product. It is their shifting behaviour in response to changing prices that leads to market equilibrium. The alternative view of the neo-Austrian school emphasizes the competitive process. In this view the market is more dynamic. Neo-Austrian economists think of the market as a process of selection occurring in changing and tumultuous conditions. They suggest that the market is often in disequilibrium. For them, the advantages of the market stem from the impact of competition on behaviour and outcomes.

The market, especially in the neoclassical view, produces coordination through exchanges and prices. People who are widely dispersed and have no knowledge of one another are nonetheless reacting to one another's effect on prices. If people I have never met start to pay more and more for a good, its price goes up, and when I see this rising price, I receive information about their actions and desires. More generally, people start to produce more of a good when its price goes up and less of it as its price goes down. Again, people start to buy less of a good (perhaps substituting another for it) as its price goes up, and they start to buy more of a good (perhaps using it as a substitute for others) when its price goes down. Prices convey information to which (p. 24) people react by altering their actions. These new actions tend to restore market equilibrium. The desires of all the market actors are thus coordinated.

People's interactions in the market often reflect its decentralized nature. The market actors are largely independent of one another. Their interactions are impersonal transactions. These interactions occur for the purpose of exchanging goods. They can be isolated or episodic rather than enduring relationships. There is no need for market relationships to involve face-to-face meetings. Social bonds and levels of trust are thus relatively low in many markets. Instead, markets often rely on laws, governments, and the threat of sanctions to enforce contracts.

Clearly prices and competition are crucial to the market. In a pure market, prices provide all of the information that people need to decide how much of a good to produce and how much of it to use. This information effectively takes the place of the supervisor or boss in a hierarchy, for people order themselves in response to the information that prices provide. Competition ensures that if one actor fails to respond to prices while others do so, the actor who does not will thus suffer the consequences. For example, if other sellers reduce the prices they charge for a good, an actor who does not will have trouble finding buyers for that same good.

Because pricing information and competition are so important to markets, their absence generally leads to market failure. For example, competition can be undermined by monopolies and cartels. A monopoly exists when one actor controls the entire supply of a good. If a relatively small number of actors effectively control the supply, they form a cartel. Both monopolies and cartels enable those actors who control the supply of a good to keep the price of that good high. These inflated prices increase the profits of monopolists and cartel members at the expense of their customers thereby preventing the market from reaching a proper equilibrium.

(p. 25) The apparent advantages of markets are now so much part of folk wisdom that it might scarcely seem worth discussing them at length. The market's advantages are both practical and moral. One practical advantage is simply that markets can often provide a degree of coordination in the absence of a supervisor who has knowledge of desirable outcomes and of ways to reach those outcomes. Markets do away with the arguably implausible idea of a benevolent and perfectly informed planner. Another practical advantage of markets is that competition within them can force out the less efficient players. This competition can lead to the spread of desirable innovations. It can reduce the cost of the goods that people need or want.

In moral terms, markets provide considerable scope for individual choice. They allow people to make fine-grained decisions about how much more they desire one good in comparison with other goods. They allow people to modify these decisions from one exchange to the next. Provided people are able to pay the costs, they are free to choose from whatever goods or services are available. Some thinkers also argue that markets and trade involve social interactions and cultural exchanges that promote peace and security.

Although folk wisdom currently focuses on the advantages of markets, we should not let it blind us to the limitations of markets. Economists have long recognized that the use of a price mechanism involves costs that can outweigh the advantages. These costs include the time and effort spent getting relevant information, locating other buyers and sellers, discovering prices, and negotiating contracts. Markets often involve some uncertainty about transactions and outcomes, and it can be costly to reduce this uncertainty. Further, because markets can fail, they usually require regulation and supervision, which is yet another cost. Firms often keep tasks in-house rather than out-sourcing them precisely in order to avoid these costs. They might not want to have to negotiate for labour over and over. They might want to (p. 26) avoid uncertainty about the supply of their raw materials. They might want to have more direct oversight of an activity.

Because prices and competition are crucial to markets, the market is often an inappropriate type of organization if prices or competition are absent. Market exchanges rarely allow, for example, for their effects on third parties. Prices can thus fail properly to reflect both social goods, such as those associated with education, and social ills, such as environmental degradation. Likewise, monopolies and cartels can make it difficult to create effective competition. Prices can thus get artificially inflated for goods for which there are a limited number of suppliers, including natural monopolies.

Finally, of course, markets are often ill suited to the distribution of goods and services about which we have strong moral intuitions. There is no reason why we should assume that the outcome of market exchanges will accord with our collective sense of social justice. If they do not, we may have to decide whether the advantages of the market are sufficient to outweigh the resulting injustices.


#### Networks

For much of the first half of the twentieth century organization theorists focused largely on hierarchies and markets. Sometimes hierarchy and market appeared as the two ends of a spectrum. Other hybrid forms of organization fell somewhere between them. These hybrid organizations seemed less than ideal. However, towards the end of the twentieth century, a growing awareness of the limitations of hierarchies and markets led organization theorists to pay more attention to hybrids. The idea of a network arose as a third type of organizational structure.

Networks consist of multiple actors who are formally separate but depend on one another for key resources and so build long-term (p. 27) relationships to exchange resources. On the one hand, networks differ from hierarchies because they do not usually contain an authoritative centre to resolve disputes among the actors. On the other, they differ from markets in that the actors engage in repeated and enduring exchanges, often relying on trust and diplomacy rather than prices and bargaining. Examples of network relationships thus can include cooperative set-ups, coalitions, relational contracting, partnerships, and joint ventures.

Because networks consist of informal relationships, they presuppose a high level of trust among the actors. It is this trust that enables the actors to build and maintain their mutually beneficial links and exchanges. Yet, trust does not just appear out of nowhere. Rather, the actors in networks generally learn to trust one another precisely because they engage in repeated and beneficial interactions. As the actors experience being part of a network, they come to trust one another not to act opportunistically in ways that would damage the network. In a sense, therefore, networks get increasingly firmly established through a spiral of goodwill. Actors begin to cooperate for mutual advantage. As they do so, they forge closer relations and start to trust each other. This trust makes it easier for them to cooperate in later exchanges. The later exchanges build further trust and thereby solidify the network. Further, this spiral of goodwill often results in the participants in networks collaborating deliberately to try to strengthen their relations. When confronted with misunderstandings and setbacks, they attempt to overcome the problems in their relations rather than simply breaking ties with one another.

Social scientists have tried to create a typology of networks or at least to identify different types of network. Many of these typologies imply that the number and density of the relations within a network explain many of its other characteristics. Although the key characteristic of all networks is the interdependence of their members, the degree of their (p. 28) interdependence can vary. Networks are more participatory when the actors have roughly equal resources. These networks resemble self-governing associations. In contrast, if one actor has the bulk of the resources, that actor often plays a particularly prominent role in the network. These networks are often managed and governed largely by the lead actor. Yet another scenario arises when an independent actor, such as a regulatory agency, oversees the network. Regulatory governance depends here on an actor outside of the network.

Organization theorists generally agree that networks are more cooperative and egalitarian than markets and hierarchies. Networks replace the competitive relationships of markets with trust and collaboration; the actors cooperate voluntarily in pursuit of mutual benefits. Networks replace the chain of command that characterizes hierarchies with a flatter structure; whether the actors are individuals or organizations, they occupy more or less equivalent places in the network, each being dependent on the others.

A lot of claims have been made recently about the alleged benefits of networks. Some organization theorists argue that networks promote the reliable and efficient flow of information. In markets, actors often keep crucial information to themselves because they think that it might help their competitors. In networks, however, because actors trust one another, they freely share information. In hierarchies, information that exists at the top can be slow to make its way down to the lower levels where it is needed. In networks, however, there may be fewer rules and procedures blocking the spread of information to those who most need it. More particularly, networks often appeal as ways of crossing organizational and conceptual boundaries; networks enable different departments and agencies to come together to address a problem that transcends their individual remits.

Some organization theorists suggest that because networks facilitate the flow of information, they are particularly useful for (p. 29) mobilizing actors and promoting change. In this view networks make it easy for members to reach out and connect with other actors, forging loose ties that further extend the network. These connections can then lead all the actors to adapt to one another and learn from one another in what thus becomes a general transformation. Also, networks can give their members an independence from any central control and thus a freedom to experiment and innovate. The successful experiments and innovations then spread across the network as part of the general transformation. Some organization theorists argue, more generally, that networks are usually more flexible and adaptive than other types of organizations.

Even if networks have advantages, they are not without problems. One criticism is that they lack stability. Some scholars argue here that trust does not ensure that actors will not behave opportunistically and even undermine the network. When actors have significantly more to gain by breaking the norms and relationships of a network than maintaining them, they may be tempted to do so. Further, the informal nature of many networks means that if an actor behaves opportunistically, the other actors may have no effective recourse to either a hierarchic authority or a legal contract enforced through the courts.

Another criticism of networks runs directly counter to some of the claims made on their behalf. Some organization theorists argue that the complexity of networks makes them inflexible. In this view a change in a network depends on the consent of all the actors. As the actors are all interdependent, a single actor cannot change the network alone. Further, because each actor depends on the others, individual actors may find it difficult even to change themselves. A related criticism is that the complexity of networks undermines coordination and control. Many networks lack a centre capable of directing them. They can become fragmented.

(p. 30) Finally, criticisms of networks have a moral and political dimension. Networks blur lines of accountability. Their complexity and especially their lack of an overt centre providing coordination and control often makes it difficult to specify who is responsible to whom for what. Historically, administrative accountability has depended on clear lines of authority in hierarchies; each individual is accountable to their boss higher up the hierarchy. Networks typically lack such lines of authority. In networks, several different actors may come together to make decisions, act, and oversee the actions. Further, the different actors may not have a boss. They may be the collaborative members of a self-governing and self-regulating organization. Problems over the legitimacy of networks have a particular resonance in democracies, for networks can be relatively closed and a few vested interests can use a policy network to pursue their factional interests at the expense of the common good.

There is much irony here. Bureaucracy was popular for much of the twentieth century because it promised to control factionalism and vested interests. Bureaucracy was meant to provide policy coordination and to defend the common good. Since the 1980s, many organization theorists and policy-makers have turned away from bureaucratic hierarchies to champion markets and more recently networks. Yet, the spread of markets and networks has now led some theorists again to worry about factionalism and vested interests. The benefits of hierarchy are becoming clear again.


#### A story of academia

Although organization theory is abstract, it has had a dramatic impact on the world. By the late twentieth century decision-makers were following organization theory in promoting markets and networks. They tried to reorganize public bureaucracies and private corporations. They wanted to reform the hierarchies of the early twentieth century by introducing market mechanisms (p. 31)
2. Organizational governance

2. Social scientific theories, such as that of a wicked problem, have had a dramatic impact on public policy in Australia and elsewhere
(p. 32) and network ties. I want to bring abstract organization theory down to earth, therefore, by telling the story of how one academic idea influenced public governance. The academic idea of a ‘wicked problem’ inspired a turn to ‘whole-of-government’ agendas.

When modern planning theory developed between the world wars, it promoted a rational approach based on centralized knowledge and hierarchic organization. Hierarchic institutions collected and studied data, evaluated courses of action, and implemented decisions. This rational planning was subject to numerous and spreading criticisms from the late 1960s onwards. From one side, neoliberals argued that rational planning was impossible and it created bureaucracies that were inherently inefficient and unresponsive. From the other side, progressives began to point to a lack of results and to the dominance of economic interests in the planning process.

The term ‘wicked problem’ arose in this context. Horst Rittel and Melvin M. Webber introduced the term in an academic paper first published in 1973. Rittel and Webber argued that wicked problems were particularly difficult to solve. They suggested that although rational planning had proved well suited to more ‘tame’ problems, it had been less successful in addressing complex and interconnected ‘wicked’ problems.

Most definitions of wicked problems refer to a list of features. Wicked problems are more or less unique. They lack definitive formulations. There are many explanations for them. There is no test to decide the value of any response to them. Each response has important consequences, so there is no real chance to learn by trial and error. Typically these features mean that wicked problems are interrelated. Any one wicked problem has complex links to others. Any response to one may impact others. Classic examples of wicked problems include pressing issues of governance such as security, environment, and urban blight.

(p. 33) Planning theorists argued that wicked problems explain the failings of hierarchies. In their view departmental silos undermine the coordination needed to solve intransigent and interrelated problems. Wicked problems require more collaborative and innovative approaches. People have to cooperate across established boundaries within and across organizations. Some planning theorists thus concluded that networks and partnerships could help solve wicked problems.

This belief in networks and partnerships encouraged decision-makers to adopt new programmes labelled ‘whole-of-government’ or ‘joined-up governance’. In an official paper, Tackling Wicked Problems, the Australian Public Service argued that wicked problems challenge bureaucratic ways of working because they are peculiarly difficult to solve. Wicked problems require ‘thinking that is capable of grasping the big picture’. They require ‘more collaborative and innovative approaches’. And they require actors to operate ‘across organizational boundaries’ in a whole-of-government approach.

So, the Australian government adopted a ‘whole-of-government’ approach to wicked problems. Another official document explains: ‘The distinguishing characteristic of whole of government work is that there is an emphasis on objectives shared across organizational boundaries, as opposed to working solely within an organization.’ Land management provides an example. In 2002 the Australian government created a Natural Resource Management Team in order to promote sustainable agricultural production and environmental protection. This management team secures cooperation and coordination among various government programmes such as the Natural Heritage Trust and the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality. Policy is formed by a multi-jurisdictional committee, the Natural Resource Management Ministerial Council, which consists of environmental and agricultural policy-makers from the federal level, the states, and local territories, and which is co-chaired by (p. 34) the heads of the Department of Environment and Heritage and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Forestry.

Academic ideas about wicked problems also inspired policy shifts at the global level. In 2005 the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) established Principles for Good Engagement in Fragile States. The Principles highlighted the importance of developing coherent programmes to span the administrative, economic, political, and security domains. The OECD created a new group to develop an explicitly ‘whole-of-government’ approach.

The OECD points to Canada's operations in Haiti as a good example of a whole-of-government approach. Canada relies on inter-organizational networks in Ottawa (the capital of Canada) and on the ground in Haiti. Canada's policies are devised and planned by an Interdepartmental Steering Group that brings together all the agencies involved. The steering group defines the broad procedures and budget for the operations in Haiti. An Interdepartmental Working Group then manages the operations. Operations on the ground in Haiti are primarily executed by the diplomatic corps and security personnel. The whole-of-government approach appears here in the emphasis on coordinating among these groups and between them and other actors. So, for example, the diplomatic corps collaborates with the international community and especially with Haitian officials, providing a channel for local ideas and inputs.

#### The cycle of modernism

Modernist organization theory concentrates on formal analyses of ideal types. As a result, hierarchies, markets, and networks often appear as abstract models with more or less intrinsic properties. There is a danger of organization theory bewitching people. For a start, scholars and decision-makers might forget that actual organizations are not abstract models. Actual organizations are (p. 35) made up of living people and their actions. It is people and their quirks, not abstract models, which determine the nature and behaviour of an organization. For example, a market consists of people acting for all kinds of reasons not all of which are in accord with the assumptions that neoclassical economists generally make about human rationality. In addition, real organizations do not correspond perfectly to any ideal type. The actions of the people in an organization generally muddle features associated with hierarchies, markets, and networks. For example, if a customer regularly buys coffee at a particular shop but forgets her purse one day, the shopkeeper might give her coffee trusting her to pay later, thereby bringing the trust associated with networks into a market relationship. Finally, although it might be reasonable to associate an ideal type with a set of properties, it is a mistake to think that these properties necessarily go together or that these properties necessarily appear in any organization resembling the ideal type.

Some organization theorists might intend their ideal types to be heuristic guides that help people think about real situations and make sensible decisions. There is always a danger, however, that other people will treat their ideal types as if they were infallible accounts of reality. This danger is particularly worrying given the impact of organization theory on the practice of management and administration. As organization theory moves from the academy to professional and policy worlds, so it often gets simplified. Even if social scientists think of their ideas as nuanced concepts, hypotheses, and simplifications of a complex reality, decision-makers often lose sight of the nuances and treat the same ideas as rigid and infallible guides. Busy decision-makers hear headlines and grab at solutions that present themselves as science. Tentative academic suggestions become dogmas. Cautious academic proposals become alleged panaceas.

As the ensuing chapters show how modernist theories have influenced the daily practice of management and administration, so they illustrate the danger of forgetting the human nature of (p. 36) social life and taking the idea of a social ‘science’ too seriously. Much of the history of the new governance consists of successive waves of modernist expertise. Each new scientific theory or ideal type appears on the scene as a panacea. Decision-makers try to solve various managerial and administrative problems by introducing a raft of reforms based on the theory. The reforms fail. Often the reforms have unexpected consequences that create more problems. Social scientists offer new theories to explain the failure of the reforms. Decision-makers turn to these other theories and introduce more reforms. So goes the cycle of modernist governance.
