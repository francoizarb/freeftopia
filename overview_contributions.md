# Typology of contributions and their evaluation mode

Of course, it is a non-exhaustive document :-)

## Towards a definition of a "contribution"

As a first try, **a contribution to a project can be defined as bringing something to the project, this something may be material or not**.  
Given this definition, let's try to find an example of an action in relation to a project, which is not a contribution. 
For instance, what to say if someone goes to a conference related to a project, but does not report it to the project community? 
It could be argued that this did not bring anything to the project, as he/she did not discuss it with any member of the project, or did not write a summary about it.
But it could also be argued that this conference made him/her change his/her point of view, which may have had a certain impact in the future. 
And if the impact is big and can be directly associated with this conference, we may say it contributed to the project.   
In this example, we see that contribution and evaluation are closely related. Which brings a second try of a definition: **a contribution is an action which is evaluated as bringing something to the project**.  


## Four types of contributions

Maybe we can take for driver something like (from Demings PDCA + project management process)
- Planification : project specification (> to add to your 4 steps, or is it included in Decision?)
- Realisation
- Control / Evaluation 
- Discussions (= project management process ?) : Communication, information diffusion, interpersonnal relations management, conflicts management, meetings planification and organization
- Decision (> see planification?)
so maybe just different words, same meaning ?  


### Realisation 

Different types of realisation (non-exhaustive list!):

| Type   | Associated tools | Evaluation criteria  | Evaluation tool |  
| -------- | ----------- | -----------  | ----------- |  
| Meeting notes drafting | Text editor<br>Collaborative text editor (e.g., google doc, overleaf, etherpad)<br>Git | Accuracy<br>Comprehensiveness<br>Clearness  | Human brain |  
| Report writing | Text editor<br>Collaborative text editor (e.g., google doc, overleaf, etherpad)<br>Git | Accuracy<br>Comprehensiveness<br>Clearness  | Human brain |  
| Documentation writing | Text editor<br>Collaborative text editor (e.g., google doc, overleaf, etherpad)<br>Git |  Accuracy<br>Comprehensiveness<br>Clearness   | Human brain |  
| Programming | Text editor<br>Git | Code optimization<br>Comments<br>Modularity  | Code efficiency |  
  

I put on this repository a document with my note of our meeting on contributions evaluation : there is a brief description of a Ftopia process, that can perhaps help to set this "realisation" contribution types ? 


### Decisions 

### Discussions 

### Evaluation 
A contribution itself!
