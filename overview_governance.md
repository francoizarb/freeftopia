Overview of governance models
=============================

This document is an overview of different governance structure with a special focus on those relevant for refactoring a small company into an open decentralized autonomous organization.


Definitions
-----------
Governance refers to "all of processes of governing, whether undertaken by a government, market or network, whether over a family, tribe, formal or informal organization or territory and whether through the laws, norms, power or language. (Bevir, 2013)" In particular Governance goes beyond the body of legal texts governing various organizations. It also includes the application of these laws to the real world, with all the social aspects involved in concretely enforcing a common set of rules. Importantly, a particular governance structure should not be judged on the paper, but rather in real life.


A typology of organizational governance
---------------------------------------
The following is largely based on chapter 2 of Mark Bevir's 'Governance: a very short introduction', 2013.

This chapter focuses on the three main concepts underpinning ‘Organizational governance’: hierarchies, markets and networks.

#### Hierarchies
##### Definition
Hierarchies have a pyramidal structure converging to a central authority which presides over a tree of subordinates units. The employees of such organizations are to obey their boss, and command over their subordinates. Hierachies are often found in private companies and public bureaucracy.

##### Characteristics
- Works best when the organization has a clear purpose.
- Encourage division of labour and specialization.
- Management is crucial.
- Employees have to follow the rules.

##### Pros
- Can handle complicated tasks.
- Clear accountability.
- Formal rules are a barrier to corruption and official bias.

##### Cons
- Unresponsive and inefficient. See Frederic Lordon's alpha angle.
- Vital need of clear criteria of success. Bosses need to evaluate / supervise
- Does not change quickly. Flexibility is made difficult by outdated rules.

#### Markets
The market is a (virtual) place where buyers and sellers exchange goods (especially money). They organize the collaboration of several parties with little contact. This organizational mechanism is not applicable to all decisions but works well for some of them.

##### Characteristics
- Decentralized structure.
- Prices are central in Markets. They gather a lot of information about a deal.
- Dynamical principles underlying prices: demand and offer.

##### Pros
- Don't need to see the other to sign a deal.
- Fosters competition.
- Provide high degree of coordination without supervision.

##### Cons
- Fosters competition.
- Can be undermined by monopolies and cartels.
- Prices and competition do not apply to everything.

#### Networks
"Networks consist of multiple actors who are formally separate but depend on one another for key resources and so build long-term relationships to exchange resources."

##### Characteristics
- Presupose and develops high level of trust between actors.
- Can be decentralized (not necessarily).

##### Pros
- Reliable and efficient flow of information.
- Useful for mobilizing actors and promoting change.
- Good for interdisciplinary and creative work.

##### Cons
- Lack of stability. A break of trust can kill a network.
- Sometimes inflexible because too complicated. One person cannot change anything major.
- No accountability.  Leads to the emergence of untouchable dominant selfish behaviors.
